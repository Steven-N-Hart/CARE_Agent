Compliance and Security
Compliance verification has been conducted, ensuring adherence to all relevant standards and regulations. A process for addressing licensing issues and integrating new dependencies from a regulatory perspective is established. The updated model performance is validated and documented according to appropriate regulatory standards.

Error Notification and Monitoring
In the event of errors, hospital risk management and health regulatory agencies will be notified. Continuous monitoring for new regulatory changes that could affect the algorithm's use is conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.

Summary
The DOP project encompasses a detailed and robust framework addressing all aspects of deployment, periodic retraining, drift detection, input/output verification, downtime procedures, performance review, clinical champion approval, quality monitoring, environmental conditions, data governance, model specification, inclusion/exclusion criteria, model explanations, patient risk and safety, regulatory and licensing considerations, compliance, and security. This ensures the model's reliability, effectiveness, and compliance with all relevant standards, providing significant value in predicting diabetes outcomes and improving patient care.
